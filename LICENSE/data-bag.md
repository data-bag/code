## 2. Grant of Rights

All copyrightable works of authorship contained in this package or repository

## 3. Amendments to the GNU Affero General Public License

In accordance with Section 7 of the AGPL, the Works included in this package
or repository, with the exception of the Works subject to [paragraphs (a)
through (c) of the Section 2 above][list-noagpl], are subject to the following
additional terms:

> 1. If you modify any covered Work by linking or combining it with any of the
components and libraries listed in the [Appendix A][app-A] or
[Appendix B][app-B] below (or modified versions of those components), covered
by terms of a license designated as permissible by the [Appendix A][app-A] or
[Appendix B][app-B] for the respective component or library, the licensors of
these Works grant you additional permission to convey the resulting work.

>	_Corresponding Source_ for a non-source form of such combination shall
	include the source code for the components and libraries listed in
	[Appendix C][app-C] below as well as that of the covered Work whenever
	those components and libraries are included in, or linked to, the resulting
	work.

> 2. IN ADDITION TO THE TERMS OF SECTIONS 15 AND 16 OF THE AGPL, AND TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORKS ARE PROVIDED TO YOU WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ARE SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR REDISTRIBUTING THE
WORK AND ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR EXERCISE OF PERMISSIONS
UNDER THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND COSTS OF
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND CLAIMS OF PATENT OR OTHER PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES. YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS
THE LICENSORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT MODIFY AND/OR CONVEY THE WORKS AS
PERMITTED ABOVE FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THIRD PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE, MODIFICATION, AND/OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORKS.

> 3. When you reproduce and distribute copies of the Works in any form, on any
medium, with or without modifications, you must:

>	_a)_ retain in the Source form of any Works that you distribute, all
	copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
	of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
	distributed Works; and

>	_b)_ cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
	changed the files; and
   
>	_c)_ If the Work includes a `NOTICE` text file as part of its distribution,
	then any Works that you distribute must include a readable copy of the
	attribution notices contained within such `NOTICE` file, excluding those
	notices that do not pertain to any part of the distributed Works, in at
	least one of the following places: within a `NOTICE` text file distributed
	as part of the distributed Works; within the Source form or documentation,
	if provided along with the distributed Works; or, within a display
	generated by the distributed Works, if and wherever such third-party
	notices normally appear. The contents of the `NOTICE` file are for
	informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add your
	own attribution notices within Works that you distribute, alongside or as
	an addendum to the `NOTICE` text from the Work, provided that such
	additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
	License. For purposes of this paragraph, a `NOTICE.md` file or a similar
	file with annotated text shall be deemed equivalent to the `NOTICE` text
	file.

> 4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of any licensor or distributor, except as 
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
and reproducing the content of the `NOTICE` file. This License does not create
a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you
and any licensors or distributors. Neither the name _"Data-bag"_ (or its
variants), nor the names of the project's contributors may be used to endorse
or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

> 5. While redistributing the Work in any form, you may choose to offer, and
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, you may act only on your own behalf and on your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other licensor or distributor, and
only if you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each licensor and each
distributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such licensor or distributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.

## 4. Changes to the Terms

From time to time, the licensors may change, remove, add to, or otherwise
modify the license terms that apply to this package or repository. Each new
version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The
project's maintainers may change Appendices to this License without assigning
a new version number to it. The Works (including modified Works) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the License under which they were
received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, you may
elect to distribute the Works under the new version.

## 5. General

Either party's failure to insist on, or enforce strict performance of, any of
the terms of this License shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision
or right. If any term or part of the License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable by any law or regulation or final determination of a competent
court or tribunal, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect
the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. A printed version
of the License (along with other documents incorporated therein by reference)
and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
administrative proceedings based on or relating to the License to the same
extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The headings in
the License are provided for convenience only and shall not be used to construe
meaning or intent.
